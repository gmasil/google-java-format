# Google Java Format
Take a look at the original readme [here](https://github.com/google/google-java-format/blob/master/README.md).

## Differences
- take over fix of eclipse plugin creation (thanks to [@tobous](https://github.com/tobous) [PR#465](https://github.com/google/google-java-format/pull/465))
- set default indentation size to 4
- set default line length to 160
- disable javadoc formatting by default
